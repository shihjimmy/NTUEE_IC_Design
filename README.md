## hw1  
several exercises to make yourself familiar with basic IC design knowledge
## hw2
### Hspice and Layouts
#### tasks:  
1.  Give ten layouts and convert them into hspice code  
2.  Simulate them through EDA tools  
## hw3
### Combinational circuit
#### tasks:  
1.  Using only Gate-level verilog  
2.  Find the Kendall rank coefficient of the four given pairs of numbers  
(My circuit can run under 3.5ns)
## hw4
### Sequential circuit
#### tasks:  
1.  Using only Gate-level verilog 
2.  Design a prime factorization circuit with reset that computes the powers of the  
    prime factors 2, 3, 5 of the target number N, namely P2, P3, and P5.  
(My circuit's performance is better than 80-90% classmates)
